Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

- This project helps manage a list of items sold throughout the day. It helps users easily digest information from a simple .txt file with a list of item names. Users can then look up their sales of a particular item or display a menu of all the items in the form of a histogram or simple numbers.

What did you do particularly well?
- I think I did well with the inline comments explaining the code.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

- I can't think of much without more experience, but I think adding more error handing and unit tests would be better when scaling.

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
- I did not really find this to be all that big of a challenge, but the cplusplus website helped deepen my understanding and is definently being used again in the future.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
- I think the file and map aspects of this project will be the most helpful for the future.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
- By simply modularizing all aspects of the program so you can easily see what it does and where to find/modify it.
